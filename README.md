# Hopin-Attendee-Scraper-Bookmarklet
<br />Simple bookmarklet to scrape attendees from Hopin events.  

<br />Save file as bookmark
<br />Go to desired Hopin event which you have registered
<br />Find "auth" in network activity 
<br />Locate event ID and Bearer
<br />Run the bookmarklet
<br />When prompted, paste (or type) event ID
<br />When prompted, paste (or type) Bearer (without the "Bearer", just the actually token)
<br />Upon completion in the browser console, right click on arrow and "Copy Object"
<br />Use your favorite JSON to CSV conversion tool (my fav = https://products.aspose.app/cells/conversion/json-to-csv)
<br />All complete, you have a full CSV of attendees, names, bios, etc.  Enjoy

<br />All credit to andrebradshaw for the JS.  I simply added prompts and a few lines for ease of shifting to a bookmarklet.
